<h1>The Best Movies According to Nour</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Movies of all Time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>12 Angry Men (1957)</h3>
<p>A movie about 12 jurors locked in a room to delibrate on the fate of a young man accused of stabbing his father. <br>
The movie is full of suspense and great character growth with great performances from the entire cast and a great premise and keeps you engaged for its 95 minute runtime. </p>
<h3>Tarzan (1999)</h3>
<p>This is just for the nostalgic effect for me but the story is great the music is outstanding courtesy of the great phill collins and just a great time.  </p>
<h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
<p>Outstanding performance by everyone involved especially Heath Ledger as the joker. Great cinematography and use of practical effects. It is just a bit too long (154 minutes) but overall defintely worth a watch. </p>
<h3>Inception (2010)</h3>
<p>One of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time with Christofer Nolan proving once again why he's a fantastic director.<br>
You get what you're used to from any Nolan film: great acting, great cinematography, great use of practical effects.</p>
<h3>Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>Another one of Christofer Nolan's hits with all the usual suspects in terms of what a Nolan film provides you with the added bonus of a great and sometimes heart-wrenching performance by Mathew McConaughey.</p>
